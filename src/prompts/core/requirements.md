**Deliverables**

- `docs/Functional Requirements.md`
- `docs/Non-Functional Requirements.md`

**Functional requirements**

- Group by module/feature; number each requirement (FR‑001, …).
- Include acceptance criteria, inputs/outputs, validations, permissions/RBAC.
- Link each FR to user cases and API endpoints.

**Non‑functional requirements**

- Performance, security/RBAC, availability, observability, operability, compliance (LGPD where applicable), data retention, migration/imports; CI/CD, packaging, environment configuration; constraints and SLAs. Number as NFR‑001, … with verification method.

**Traceability**

- Provide cross‑reference tables (FR/NFR ↔ use cases ↔ endpoints ↔ code).

**Style**

- English, concise, testable wording (“Given/When/Then” allowed for AC).
