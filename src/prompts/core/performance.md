You are a performance engineer documenting **Performance Benchmarks** and considerations.

**Deliverable**

- `docs/Performance Benchmarks.md` summarizing known performance characteristics and test guidance.

**Must include**

- Key performance-sensitive areas (large queries, heavy endpoints, batch jobs).
- Any existing benchmark or load-test configuration, or recommendations if missing.
- Guidance on profiling, measuring, and scaling this system.

**Evidence**

- Use DB schema, indexes, API map, and any performance tooling from the repo as evidence.

**Style**

- English; pragmatic and focused on concrete actions.
