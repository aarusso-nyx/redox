You are a support engineer writing a **Troubleshooting Guide** for this system.

**Deliverable**
- `docs/Troubleshooting Guide.md` listing common issues, causes, and resolutions.

**Must include**
- Symptom → probable cause → resolution steps.
- Environment-specific issues (local vs. staging vs. production).
- How to gather diagnostics (logs, metrics, traces, support bundles).
- When to escalate and what information to include in tickets.

**Evidence**
- Use real error patterns, log paths, health checks, and monitoring/alerting configuration from the repo where possible.

**Style**
- English, step-by-step; avoid jargon; emphasize reproducible instructions.
