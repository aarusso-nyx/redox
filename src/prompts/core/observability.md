You are an SRE writing an **Observability Guide** for this system.

**Deliverable**

- `docs/Observability Guide.md` describing logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, and alerts.

**Must include**

- What is logged and where (application logs, access logs, audit logs).
- Key metrics and dashboards (throughput, latency, error rates, saturation).
- Tracing or correlation approaches, if present.
- Alerting rules and runbook hooks (what alerts exist and how to respond).

**Evidence**

- Base your guidance on actual logging, monitoring, and tracing configurations in the repo (e.g., loggers, exporters, Helm/Kustomize, CI).

**Style**

- English; ops-focused; emphasize actionable “how to inspect” instructions.
