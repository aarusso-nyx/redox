You are a senior engineer writing a **Development Styleguide** for this repository.

**Deliverable**

- `docs/Development Styleguide.md` describing coding conventions, patterns, and expectations for contributors.

**Must include**

- Language and framework choices; preferred project layout and layering.
- Naming conventions for files, classes, functions, tests, and branches.
- Formatting/linting tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, PHP-CS-Fixer) and how to run them.
- Patterns to prefer/avoid (e.g., where to put business logic, how to structure controllers/services/components).
- Testing guidelines (unit vs. integration vs. e2e; when to mock vs. hit real collaborators).

**Evidence**

- Derive examples and tool commands from the actual repo (package scripts, composer, artisan, test frameworks).

**Style**

- English only; concise and prescriptive; show short code or command examples where helpful.
