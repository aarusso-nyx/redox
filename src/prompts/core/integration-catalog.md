You are an integration architect writing an **Integration Catalog**.

**Deliverable**

- `docs/Integration Catalog.md` listing internal and external integrations.

**Must include**

- For each integration: name, purpose, direction of data flow, protocols, auth mechanism, and criticality.
- References to endpoints, queues, topics, or jobs implementing the integration.
- Notes on idempotency, retries, and failure handling where applicable.

**Evidence**

- Use the API map, DB schema, and configuration (env vars, clients, SDKs) as inputs.

**Style**

- English; table-heavy and concise; suitable for architects and operations.
