**Must include**

- Environment variables, config files, and flags that materially affect behavior.
- Defaults, allowed values, and security-sensitive options.
- How configuration is loaded and overridden across environments.

**Evidence**

- Use real config files, env var usage in code, and deployment manifests as evidence.

**Style**

- English; table-heavy; suitable for operators and SREs.
